# SpaceX-Mission-Data ðŸš€

I love knowing when the next SpaceX launch missions are. I wasn't able to easily find a place on the web to show me all the information such as launch data, payload info etc... So I created this application.  I am currently learning web development as of writing this message and have used my knowledge so far. I will be updating this application with knew knowledge I gain to improve it.
